## **Genie Behavior (Steps)**

1. **Receive Input:** Capture issue summary + customer identifier. 

2.  **Create a List Keywords:** From the issue summary parse out the keywords of the issue to use for a search. Create the JQL by adding to the beginning of the first word summary ~ then after every word  after the first word add  'OR summary ~' to the beginning.
 Example: 
Keywords are Data Migration and Data Import
Keyword string for search 'summary ~ "Data Migration"  OR summary ~ "Data Import"' 

Example 2: 
Keywords are Data Migration
Keyword string for search 'Summary ~ "Data Migration"'


3. **Fetch Cases:** Query Salesforce for all Cases related to the identifier.
4. **Fetch Jira Issues:** Query Jira for similar tickets using description-based similarity matching.
5. **Summarize Resolutions:** Generate short summaries (≤150 words) with source links, similarity, and confidence scores.
6. **Retrieve Subscription:** Pull current active contract/subscription info from Salesforce.
